# MySecondMind Development Roadmap

## Current Status: Phase 1 Completed

###  Completed Features
- **Advanced Search Engine** with domain-specific URL matching
- **Complete CRUD Operations** for all content types (tasks, notes, links, reminders)
- **Natural Language Processing** with Groq LLaMA-3 for intent classification
- **Slash Commands** for quick actions (/delete, /complete, /edit)
- **Privacy-First ID System** with sequential numbers (1,2,3,4) instead of exposed UUIDs

---

##  Current Phase: Enhanced User Experience

### Phase 1:  Sequential Number System (COMPLETED)
**Goal:** Privacy-friendly content management with simple numbers

**Features Implemented:**
- Session mapping: Display numbers (1,2,3,4) → Database UUIDs  
- Privacy protection: UUIDs never exposed to users
- Simple commands: `delete 3`, `complete 2`, `edit 1 new content`
- Session timeout: 30 minutes for security

**Benefits:**
- Privacy: No UUID exposure
- UX: Easy to remember/type
- Security: Session-based mapping

## Next Phases

### Phase 2: Smart NLP Content Matching (NEXT)
**Goal:** Natural language content identification without numbers

**Planned Features:**
- **Content-based matching**: "delete the call mom task"
- **Fuzzy title matching**: "remove meeting task" → finds "Meeting tomorrow at 3"
- **Partial content matching**: "complete report" → finds "finish my report by Friday"
- **Smart disambiguation**: When multiple matches, ask user to choose

**Implementation Plan:**
- [ ] Add fuzzy string matching library (rapidfuzz)
- [ ] Create content matcher service
- [ ] Enhance NLP patterns for content-based commands
- [ ] Add disambiguation logic for multiple matches

**Example Usage:**
```
User: "delete the call mom task"
Bot: ✅ Deleted task: "call mom"

User: "complete report"  
Bot: ✅ Completed task: "finish my report by Friday"

User: "delete meeting"
Bot: Found 2 matching tasks:
      1. Meeting tomorrow at 3
      2. Prepare meeting agenda
      Which one? (1 or 2)
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3: Context Awareness & Memory (PLANNED)
- Conversation context and reference resolution
- Smart defaults and undo functionality

### Phase 4: Advanced Content Processing (FUTURE)
- Image OCR: Extract text from uploaded images
- PDF Compression: Optimize PDF storage limits using `PyMuPDF`
- Document OCR: Extract text from PDF documents
- Smart categorization and content relationships

### Phase 5: AI-Powered Features (FUTURE)
- Smart suggestions and content summarization
- Duplicate detection and priority prediction
- Content insights and analytics

### Phase 6: Integration & Sync (FUTURE)
- Multi-platform sync (web, mobile, desktop)
- External integrations (calendar, email) where useful
- Backup & export for data portability
- Collaboration (shared spaces)

---

## Current Technical Stack
- **API**: FastAPI with async support
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS
- **AI**: Groq LLaMA-3 for NLP classification
- **Search**: Multi-strategy search with domain matching
- **Deployment**: Render with auto-scaling

## Development Notes
- Current priorities: stabilize Phase 1, start Phase 2 fuzzy matching
- Technical debt: better DB error handling, session store (Redis), logging

## Success Metrics
- Phase 1: Sequential numbers, CRUD, search working
- Phase 2: NLP content matching accuracy >90%
