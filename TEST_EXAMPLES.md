- Time parsing: < 1 second
- Content saving: 1-2 seconds

### **Intelligence Level:**
- Should feel like ChatGPT-level conversation
- Context-aware responses

## **If Something Doesn't Work**

### **Check Render Logs For:**
```
✅ "Advanced AI conversation engine initialized"
✅ "Semantic search engine initialized"  
✅ "Notification scheduler initialized"
✅ "🧠 Processing with Advanced AI - user XXXXX"
```

### **Common Issues:**
1. **"Advanced AI failed"** → Check GROQ_API_KEY
2. **"Semantic search not available"** → Dependencies installing (wait 2-3 minutes)
3. **No notifications** → Check APScheduler initialization
4. **No weather in briefing** → WEATHER_API_KEY not set (optional)

## **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
- Conversations feel natural and intelligent
- Bot remembers context from previous messages
- Semantic search finds related content by meaning
- Time parsing works with natural expressions
- Actual notifications arrive at scheduled times
- Bot proactively suggests helpful actions

**Your bot should now feel like a truly intelligent assistant!**
