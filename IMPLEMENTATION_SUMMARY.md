## **What Your Users Can Now Do**

### **Natural Conversations**
```
User: "I learned something interesting about quantum computing today"
Bot: "That sounds fascinating! I'd love to help you save that knowledge. 
      What specifically did you learn about quantum computing? I can store 
      it as a note so you can easily find it later."
```

### **Smart Time Understanding**
```
User: "Remind me to call mom tomorrow at 3pm"
Bot: "Perfect! I've set your reminder for March 15, 2024 at 3:00 PM. 
      You'll get a notification then!"
```

### **Semantic Search**
```
User: "Find everything about productivity"
Bot: [Returns content about efficiency, time management, workflows, etc. 
     even if they don't contain the exact word "productivity"]
```

### **Intelligent Followups**
```
User: "Remind me about the meeting"
Bot: "I'd be happy to set that reminder! When is the meeting you'd like 
      to be reminded about? Try something like 'tomorrow at 2pm' or 'in 1 hour'."
```
